# B-Tree Project

This project is an implementation of a B-Tree in C, developed as part of a practical assignment. The B-Tree is a data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, insertions, deletions, and sequential access in logarithmic time.

## Features

- Creation of a B-Tree with a user-specified order
- Insertion of keys into the B-Tree
- Deletion of keys from the B-Tree
- Search for keys in the B-Tree
- Printing the structure of the B-Tree
- Reading keys from an input file

## File Structure

- `main.c`: Contains the main function and the options menu.
- `btree.h`: Declarations of the functions and data structures used.
- `btree.c`: Implementations of the functions for manipulating the B-Tree.
